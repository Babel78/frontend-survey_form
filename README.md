# Survey Form v1

Just testing out the basics. 

### This is just a simple form! Let's collaborate and turn it into something other than "simple" by adding YOUR OWN flair to it.

- The form does not submit anywhere. I'd like for it to be kept that way while we experiment and focus on the form itself.

### After you add your own flair to this form, list your name below and link it to your portfolio. Note what changes/improvements you've made also.
